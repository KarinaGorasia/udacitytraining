## Project title
DS Write a blog post - Bike Sharing Demand

## Motivation
Data Science Udacity course requires writing a blog post. In this case I have explored Kaggle's popular 'Bike Sharing Demand' competition, and written a blog post on how to model this problem. The notebook uploaded to this repo shows EDA and modelling techniques used throughout to develop DS skills using this project.

The final blog post can be found here:

## Tech/libraries used
Developed in jupyter notebook
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels, datetime

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Install Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter notebooks

## How to use?
Create a pull request for the notebook or download to local environment. Ensure all the packages are installed locally so you can import. I have used the Anaconda environment which provides inbuilt packages so importing is easy and no need to pip install.
